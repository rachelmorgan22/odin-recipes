<h2>This mushroom soup is creamy and rich — it's one of my favorite soups of all time and it's so easy! The long, slow caramelization of the mushrooms requires a little patience, but it really unlocks their magical flavor, which is the secret to this mushroom soup.</h2>

<h3>You're bound to love the uniquely earthy and creamy flavor of Chef John's mushroom soup recipe. Garlic, cream, and fresh thyme join meaty caramelized mushrooms and diced onions for a rich, fragrant bowlful of homemade goodness. </h3>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>

   <li>2(16 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
    
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    
    <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
    
    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    
    <li>6 spriggs fresh thyme</li>
    
    <li>2 gloves garlic</li>
    
   <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
    
    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</li>
    
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    
    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    
   <li>1 teaspoon salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes. Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Purée soup with a blender in batches until smooth and thick.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Stir in cream.</li>
</ol>
